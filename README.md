# Mandoline
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/mtao/mandoline/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/mtao/mandoline/tree/master)
A robust cut-cell mesh generator for arbitrary triangle-mesh inputs

## State of the code
The `dev` branch has more features and has several bug fixes but requires C++20 and doesn't consistently pass circleci. As there is currently one developer working on this in their free time (while using it in their own work) the development efforts are fairly focused. But please let [mtao](https://github.com/mtao) know if you encounter any issues! There may already be a fix in `dev` that needs to be ported over to `master` or he might have the time / be able to fix it up for you!

## Serialization
By default Mandoline uses [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) for serialization, following the format of defined at [proto/cutmesh.proto](https://github.com/mtao/mandoline/blob/master/proto/cutmesh.proto). This is language agnostic and so in theory, so long as your language has protobuf support/bindings you can read the output of Mandoline. In fact a lot of initial validity testing on Mandoline were done in python.

## Examples/Tools
There are a few examples / tools that are provided.
They can be built by 
```bash
make example_name
```

### curve_drawing_2d
In ```examples/curve_drawing_2d``` there is an example of how to run the 2D version of Mandoline on a drawn curve.

After drawing a curve press `Make CCM` to build the cutmesh. By default it should show Random colors for each cut-cell, but that visualization mode can be changed by the Combo box at the top of the gui widget (regions = 1 color per region; Harmonic = the solution to a Poisson equation based off the boundary; Harmonic_RHS shows the right hands used in the Poisson equations).

### Boundary curve input/output
in `boundary_curve_to_cutmesh2` one can pass in a cutmesh file of the format defined in [2D Format](https://github.com/mtao/mandoline/wiki/2D-Format).


### make_cutmesh_gui
We provide a visual interface for creating cutmeshes from OBJ files whose code is found at  ```tools/make_cutmesh_gui.cpp```, which provides a gui widget for changing the grid resolution, grid bounding box, etc before making a cutmesh and saving it to disk. The obj file is a commandoline argument.
```bash
make_cutmesh_gui obj_filename.obj
```
### cutmesh_info
We provide a simple tool for inspecting high level details about a cutmesh file, whose code is found in ```tools/cutmesh_info.cpp```. The meat of it is found at ```src/tools/cutmesh_info.cpp``` for those curious.
```bash
cutmesh_info cutmesh_file.cutmesh
```


### Compilation
Mandoline depends on a C++17 enabled compiler
- [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org) with version >= 8.2.0 or [clang](https://clang.llvm.org) with version >= 8 should work.
- [cmake](https://cmake.org) with version >= 3.11.1 .
```bash
apt install git cmake build-essential gcc
```

as well as a few other annoying things in the subsequent sections.

Once everything in subsequent sections has been installed, mandoline can be bulit by

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j5
```

### Built-in Libraries
Mandoline depends on a few libraries that it will fetch on its own:
- Michael Tao's messy ``[core](https://github.com/mtao/core)'' library,
- [libigl](https://github.com/libigl/libigl) for its ability to make intersection-free triangle meshes,


### Required External Libraries
- A relatively new verison of [Eigen3](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org) is required (3.3.7 or the development branch?). The version provided by libigl will not suffice. MAndoline might fetch its own if your Eigen is not new enough.
- [tbb](https://software.intel.com/en-us/tbb) for multithreading.
- [Google Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) is required for the default cutmesh serialization format.
- [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org) is required for almost every bit of linear algebra. If the currently available version is insufficeintly high mandoline's build will fetch a sufficiently new version

```bash
apt install libboost-thread-dev  libeigen3-dev protobuf-compiler 
```



In order to handle self-intersections Mandoline requires, on top of libigl,
- [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org)
- [gmp](https://gmplib.org)
- [mpfr](https://www.mpfr.org).

```bash
apt install libboost-thread-dev libmpfr-dev libmpfrc++-dev libcgal-dev 
libmpfr-dev libmpfrc++-dev libcgal-dev
```

### Optional Libraries
- [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org) is a really good idea, Eigen uses it a [bit](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/TopicMultiThreading.html) but I'm trying to switch to `tbb` for most uses in Mandoline itself.
- [Magnum](https://github.com/mosra/magnum) and [Corrade](https://github.com/mosra/corrade) (version >= 2019.10) for visualization.
- [imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) for visualizing things as well.
Targets that depend on visualization can be enabled by ```-DUSE_OPENGL ON``` when running cmake. They will be automatically fetched.

OpenGL stuff probably requiers the following on ubuntu:
```bash
apt install libgl-dev libopenal-dev libglfw3-dev libsdl2-dev libbullet-dev libglm-dev
```
